You will need to create a file with information about the samples in your experiment/run before executing the pipeline. Use the `--input` parameter to specify its location. It has to be a comma-separated file with 5 columns and a no header row:

## Specifying a reference genome

## Samplesheet input

## Specifying the output folder

## Running the pipeline
